      description:
        "Darwin observed that, on different islands of the Galapagos, finches had evolved different beaks adapted to eating the food that was abundant. In this simulation, flowers with simulated genomes adapt to an imaginary environment where genes that help them are emphasized and genes that don't are suppressed. All of the flowers begin with the same genome, as natural selection (with some random variation) leads them down paths to new phenotypes. Press spacebar to restart with new flowers.",

      description:
        "Viscera // Vector explores the tension between organic intuition and digital precision. Animated forms drift like liquid organs beneath a surface of structured design, their slow collisions and rebounds echoing a heartbeat inside a mechanical frame. The fluid motion evokes a living system—breathing, shifting, and recombining—while the glitching typography and cycling text at the foreground reveal the human urge to express, type, and iterate within constraint.<br><br>This piece blurs the boundaries between analog warmth and digital calculation. It embodies the friction between creation as <em>feeling</em> and creation as <em>process</em>, where motion data becomes emotion, and algorithms simulate touch. The result is both meditative and technical — a digital organism suspended in aesthetic balance, where <em>viscera</em> meets <em>vector</em>.",

      title: "My Other Computer is a Loom",
      description:
        "Both looms and computers rely on pattern, structure, and the transformation of information into form, creating a shared language that has connected these technologies throughout history. Invented in 1804, the Jacquard loom's punch card system directly inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and Ada Lovelace's pioneering programming work. Translating traditional drafting notation into code, my piece demonstrates how looms and computers transform sequential inputs into complex patterns through repetition. As a textile artist who typically works with floor loom weaving and dyeing, this digital work displays my love for complex weave drafting in a contemporary medium.",

        "This is a sketch of all of the creeks in Clear Creek county arranged by text size based on cubic feet per second. I took this data from the Colorado surface water conditions, the API required a password so instead I downloaded a CSV to fill the data for the sketch. My focus with this project was to keep the coding as efficient as possible. it took me sometime to get the text animation correct but I am happy with how it turned out. That process helped me to understand how to use nested loops. If I were to continue developing this idea, I think it would be important to give some information about how the creeks flow changes through the year to make a more salient educational data visualization.",
